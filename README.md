Arogya Co-pilot
The Unified AI Health Ecosystem for Bharat.

üéØ Mission & Vision
Arogya Co-pilot is a comprehensive, AI-driven web application designed to serve as a personal health assistant for the diverse, multilingual population of India. The project's core mission is to make advanced health information and preliminary analysis tools accessible, understandable, and usable for everyone, regardless of their native language.

It aims to bridge the gap in healthcare accessibility by providing a suite of intelligent modules that can analyze health data, offer wellness plans, check for drug interactions, and connect users with local health services.

‚ú® Core Features
Deep Multilingual Support: Fully operational in English and 9 major Indian languages.

Secure User Authentication: Supports both email/password and anonymous guest sessions via Firebase.

Modular Architecture: A wide range of specialized "Health Modules" for targeted analysis.

Advanced AI Integration: Leverages the Google Gemini API for powerful text, image, and audio analysis, as well as conversational AI and Text-to-Speech (TTS).

Interactive UI/UX: A modern interface featuring glassmorphism, 3D animations with Three.js, and a fully responsive design for all devices.

üõ†Ô∏è Technological Stack
The application is built as a single-file web app, relying on modern web technologies and external services delivered via CDNs for simplicity and rapid deployment.

Frontend:

HTML5

Tailwind CSS (Utility-first CSS framework)

JavaScript (ES Modules)

3D Graphics & Animation:

Three.js

Backend & Authentication:

Firebase Auth (Email/Password & Anonymous sign-in)

Firestore (Intended for future use)

Artificial Intelligence & Services:

Google Gemini API: The central AI engine for:

Multimodal Analysis (Text, Image, Audio)

Natural Language Understanding & Generation

üöÄ Features in Detail
üîê User Authentication
The application provides a secure and flexible authentication flow managed by Firebase Auth.

Email & Password: Users can create an account or log in using their email and password.

Anonymous Access: Users can choose to "Continue Anonymously" for immediate access without creating an account. An anonymous UID is generated for session management.

Dynamic UI: The interface, including the visibility of the "Logout" button and the user ID display, updates automatically based on the user's authentication state.

üåç Multilingual Interface
Accessibility is a cornerstone of the project, with robust support for 10 languages.

Language Selection: Users can select their preferred language from a dropdown menu on both the initial login modal and the main dashboard header.

Dynamic Translation: The setLanguage() function dynamically updates all text elements in the DOM by referencing a comprehensive translations object in the JavaScript. This ensures a seamless language switch without reloading the page.

üß© Modular Architecture
The application's functionality is organized into distinct Health Modules, each designed for a specific purpose.

Module Discovery: Modules are displayed in a scrollable list in the sidebar, each with an icon, title, and description.

Dynamic Rendering: Clicking a module triggers the renderModule() function, which clears the main content area and builds the specific UI (input fields, file upload zones, buttons) required for that module.

Scalability: The architecture is highly scalable. New modules can be easily added to the allModules array with their required configuration without needing to change the core rendering logic.

HTML <body>: Defines the complete DOM structure for the modal, main app wrapper, sidebar, and assistant panel.

<script type="module">: The core of the application logic.

Global State (state object): A single object holds the application's state, such as selectedLanguage, isLoggedIn, activeModule, etc.

Initialization (DOMContentLoaded): This is the entry point. It initializes Firebase, sets up the Three.js scene, and attaches all primary event listeners.

renderModule(module): The primary function for UI generation. It acts as a router, building the appropriate HTML form for the selected module and injecting it into the main content area.

setupModuleEventListeners(module): Called after a module is rendered, this function attaches the necessary event listeners (e.g., the "Analyze" button click handler).

callGeminiAPI(...): The central function for interacting with the Gemini model. It constructs the API payload, handles the fetch request with a retry mechanism, and displays the response.

Helper Functions: Numerous helper functions manage tasks like language translation (getTranslation), DOM manipulation (getEl), file handling (handleFileUpload), and chat message display (displayChatMessage).

üîß Setup & Deployment
