**Arogya Co-pilot: Project Documentation**
**1. Project Overview**
Project Name: Arogya Co-pilot
Tagline: The Unified AI Health Ecosystem for Bharat.
Mission & Vision
Arogya Co-pilot is a comprehensive, AI-driven web application designed to serve as a personal health assistant for the diverse, multilingual population of India. The project's core mission is to make advanced health information and preliminary analysis tools accessible, understandable, and usable for everyone, regardless of their native language.
It aims to bridge the gap in healthcare accessibility by providing a suite of intelligent modules that can analyze health data, offer wellness plans, check for drug interactions, and connect users with local health services.
Core Features
Deep Multilingual Support: Fully operational in English and 9 major Indian languages.
Secure User Authentication: Supports both email/password and anonymous guest sessions via Firebase.
Modular Architecture: A wide range of specialized "Health Modules" for targeted analysis.
Advanced AI Integration: Leverages the Google Gemini API for powerful text, image, and audio analysis, as well as conversational AI and Text-to-Speech (TTS).
Interactive UI/UX: A modern interface featuring glassmorphism, 3D animations with Three.js, and a fully responsive design for all devices.

**2. Technological Stack**
The application is built as a single-file web app, relying on modern web technologies and external services delivered via CDNs for simplicity and rapid deployment.
Frontend:
HTML5: The structural backbone of the application.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building the responsive and modern user interface.
JavaScript (ES Modules): The core logic of the application, handling everything from UI rendering to API calls.
3D Graphics & Animation:
Three.js: Used to create the immersive and aesthetically pleasing animated 3D background with particles and a DNA helix.
Backend & Authentication:
Firebase Auth: Manages secure user authentication, supporting email/password and anonymous sign-in methods.
Firestore: (Intended for future use) To store user data, module history, and other persistent information.
Artificial Intelligence & Services:
Google Gemini API: The central AI engine for:
Multimodal Analysis: Processing text, images (medical reports, skin conditions), and audio (coughs, vocal biomarkers).
Natural Language Understanding & Generation: Powering the Arogya Assistant chatbot and generating insights within modules.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Providing voice-based output for AI responses in multiple languages.
Web Speech API: Integrated for speech-to-text functionality, allowing users to interact with the assistant and modules using their voice.

**3. Features in Detail**
**3.1.** User Authentication
The application provides a secure and flexible authentication flow managed by Firebase Auth.
Email & Password: Users can create an account or log in using their email and password.
Anonymous Access: Users can choose to "Continue Anonymously" for immediate access without creating an account. An anonymous UID is generated for session management.
Dynamic UI: The interface, including the visibility of the "Logout" button and the user ID display, updates automatically based on the user's authentication state.
3.2. Multilingual Interface
Accessibility is a cornerstone of the project, with robust support for 10 languages.
Language Selection: Users can select their preferred language from a dropdown menu on both the initial login modal and the main dashboard header.
Dynamic Translation: The setLanguage() function dynamically updates all text elements in the DOM by referencing a comprehensive translations object in the JavaScript. This ensures a seamless language switch without reloading the page.
**3.3.** Modular Architecture
The application's functionality is organized into distinct Health Modules, each designed for a specific purpose.
Module Discovery: Modules are displayed in a scrollable list in the sidebar, each with an icon, title, and description.
Dynamic Rendering: Clicking a module triggers the renderModule() function, which clears the main content area and builds the specific UI (input fields, file upload zones, buttons) required for that module
Scalability: The architecture is highly scalable. New modules can be easily added to the allModules array with their required configuration without needing to change the core rendering logic.

**3.5.** Arogya Assistant & TTS
Conversational AI: A slide-out chat panel provides a general-purpose AI assistant for health-related questions. It supports both text and voice input.
Text-to-Speech: AI-generated responses in both the modules and the assistant can be read aloud. The speak() function:
Calls the Gemini TTS API with the text and selected language.
Receives raw PCM audio data.
Converts the PCM data into a playable WAV blob in the browser.
Manages an Audio object to play the sound and update the UI state.
**4.** Code Structure & Logic
The entire application is self-contained within index.html.
<style> block: Contains all the CSS, including custom styles and variables that complement Tailwind CSS.
HTML <body>: Defines the complete DOM structure for the modal, main app wrapper, sidebar, and assistant panel.
<script type="module">: The core of the application logic.
Global State (state object): A single object holds the application's state, such as selectedLanguage, isLoggedIn, activeModule, etc.
Initialization (DOMContentLoaded): This is the entry point. It initializes Firebase, sets up the Three.js scene, and attaches all primary event listeners for user interaction.
renderModule(module): This is the primary function for UI generation. It acts as a router, building the appropriate HTML form for the selected module and injecting it into the main content area.
setupModuleEventListeners(module): This function is called after a module is rendered. It attaches the necessary event listeners, most importantly the "click" handler for the "Analyze" button, which is responsible for collecting all user inputs for that module.
callGeminiAPI(...): The central function for interacting with the Gemini model. It constructs the API payload (including system prompt, user text, and any base64-encoded files), handles the fetch request with a retry mechanism, and displays the response or an error message.
Helper Functions: Numerous helper functions manage tasks like language translation (getTranslation), DOM manipulation (getEl), file handling (handleFileUpload), and chat message display (displayChatMessage).
**5.** Setup & Deployment
Dependencies
The project has no local dependencies or build steps. All required libraries are loaded directly from CDNs:
Tailwind CSS
Three.js
Firebase SDK (App, Auth, Firestore)
Firebase Configuration
To run the application, you must have a Firebase project with Authentication enabled. The application is designed to receive its Firebase configuration from globally injected variables:
__firebase_config__: A JSON string containing the Firebase project credentials.
__app_id__: A unique identifier for the application instance.
__initial_auth_token__: An optional pre-generated token for seamless sign-in.
Deployment
The index.html file can be deployed on any static web hosting service, such as:
Firebase Hosting
GitHub Pages
Netlify
Vercel
No server-side logic is required, as all backend operations are handled through the client-side Firebase SDK and calls to the Google Gemini API.
